# Getting Started with BAM

## 1. Create a Reddit App

You need to create your own Reddit application for running BAM (each subreddit is separate, to avoid rate limiting issues). You can create an app by visiting your Reddit [application preferences page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). Scroll all the way to the bottom of that and click "create another app..."

Make sure you choose the `script` type. You can enter whatever you want for the redirect URL - it won't be used.
